All of our models could be improved upon. The increased flexibility of the zero-inflated Poisson did seem to improve fit, but not to the extent desired. Similarly, the regional model suffered from a rigid variance/mean relationship. An improvement to both of these models could potentially be to allow more flexible fit with a mixture model, like a Poisson-Gamma. This could then be carried over into the regional model in the same fashion as explained in this paper.

Further exploration of time dependence within stores and across the region could yield more interesting results. An extension of the deviance residual concept to a non-exponential dispersion family model would help with assessing the fit of a zero-inflated model. Addittionally, different relationships between price and the conditional expected values in the zero-inflated model could be investigated. Specifically, a look at Prregibon's link for the consumer interest latent variable might be interesting.
