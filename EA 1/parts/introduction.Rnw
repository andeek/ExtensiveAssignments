In this extensive assignment, we look at data on daily sales of green beans at \Sexpr{length(unique(dat.orig$store))}. This data set has \Sexpr{comma(nrow(dat.orig))} observations on \Sexpr{ncol(dat.orig)} variables. We are interested in modeling the number of units sold ({\tt mvm}) as a function of the selling price ({\tt price}) for each store ({\tt store}) separately as well as a regional model for a large set of stores simultaneously.

We fit three models,\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]\item a simple Poisson for each store, \item a Zero-Inflated Poisson for each store, and \item a regional Zero-Inflated Poisson with Normal prior distributions \end{inparaenum} for the regression parameters. Section 2 will present exploratory data analysis performed prior to model formulation to profile the data set at hand. In section 3, we detail the model formulation for all three models and section 4 displays the results from all three models. Section 5 contains diagnostics for all three models used to determine fit and adequacy for use. We conclude with some closing remarks and potential extensions to our models in section 6. All {\tt R} code used in this assignment as well as some further details on fitting can be found in the appendices.
