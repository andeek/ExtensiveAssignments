In this extensive assignment, we look at data on daily sales of green beans at \Sexpr{length(unique(dat.orig$store))} stores. The data set is comprised of \Sexpr{comma(nrow(dat.orig))} observations on \Sexpr{ncol(dat.orig)} variables. Of these variables, we are specifically interested in modeling the number of units sold ({\tt mvm}) as a function of the selling price ({\tt price}). We consider models that explore this relationship for each store ({\tt store}), separately, as well as a regional model fit to a large set of stores simultaneously.\\

We fit three models,\begin{inparaenum}[(1)]\item a simple Poisson regression fit to each store, \item a Zero-Inflated Poisson fit to each store, and \item a regional Hierarchical Zero-Inflated Poisson with Normal prior distributions \end{inparaenum} for the regression parameters. Section 2 presents exploratory data analysis performed prior to model formulation to profile the data set at hand. In section 3, we detail the model formulation for all three models, and section 4 displays the results from the three models. Section 5 contains diagnostics used to determine fit and adequacy for use for all three models. We conclude with some closing remarks and potential extensions to our models in section 6. All {\tt R} code used in this assignment as well as some further details on fitting can be found in the appendices.
