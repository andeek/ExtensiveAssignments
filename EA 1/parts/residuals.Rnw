For the simple Poisson model we can look at deviance residuals because it is a member of an exponential dispersion family. On the other hand, the zero-inflated Poisson model is not a member of an exponential dispersion family, so it doesn't fit nicely with the deviance framework. For this reason, we look at standardized residuals for to be able to compare thse models. We will use residual comparison for two reasons: (1) to check fit of each model, and (2) to look at residuals over time. Looking at residuals over time will allow us to examine patterns over time as a part of model fitting.
