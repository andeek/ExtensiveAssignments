The mixture model for type A and type B steel types represented the data much better than a model with constant flaw rate across segments. This is consistent with the assumption that tracks of steel type A have a lower rate of flaws than tracks of type B material. While maximum likelihood estimates could have been found using direct maximization of the likelihood function, the EM algorithm allowed us to easily compute the probability that each individual segment belonged to type A (or likewise, type B). The estimate of the overall probability that a segment was constructed of type A steel ($\hat{\phi} = \Sexpr{phi.est}$) suggests that approximately half of the track segments were of type A steel, half of type B. The estimates of parameters $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, corresponding to type A and type B, respectively, suggest that tracks of type B are susceptible to approximately six times the number of flaws per kilometer as type A segments. The results of this study indicate that those responsible for determining the steel used to construct subway tracks should use type A over type B material if they are at all concerned for passengers' safety!
